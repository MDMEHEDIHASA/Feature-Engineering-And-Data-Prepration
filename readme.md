There are 3 parts
In the first part I cutout the outliers part and create new CSV file name Ames_outliers_remove.csv
In the second Part I am handling the missing data and adjusting them then create new csv file name Ames_Housing_Remove_Missing_Data.csv
In the third Part I am dealin with the categorical data and create final csv file name Ames_Housing_After_Daling_with_Categorical_Data.csv
